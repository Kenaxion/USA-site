Hello! Welcome to the no nonsense United States of America Website!

The goal of this site is to convey a simple approach to the United States of America. 

A non-biased, purely factual, straight-to-the-point, and abridged version of our history.

That means, no politics, no opinions, no religion, just the United States of America in all its splendor. 

The site utilizes HTML for the basic framework, CSS for hover effects, fade in & outs, dropdown menus, and several other design assets, JavaScript for the slightly more indepth animation aspects and using JSON for the state database.
